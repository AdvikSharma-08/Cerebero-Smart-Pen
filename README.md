   - Processes images, audio, and motion data
   - Implements OCR using PaddleOCR
   - Performs translations using Google Translate
   - Provides mathematical expression evaluation
   - Manages drawing and cursor control functionality

2. **Client (ESP32)**
   - Captures images through the onboard camera
   - Records audio through microphone
   - Transmits data to the server
   - Receives processed information back
   - Controls LED illumination
   - Handles user input through stylus buttons
